            <h2><strong>Youtube Radio</strong></h2>
            <p>
               What you are listening to, is a random track out of one of my <span class="green-shit">Youtube</span> music playlists.

                Spotify API is pretty cool, that's how I had the radio working but now I use something better... Youtube API(!) Had a hard time getting spotify API to work the way I wanted, but Youtube API is so easy!
