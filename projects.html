            Best project I've had yet, is this site you are currently seeing.

            I've had countless projects in university but none of them makes me really proud, with a few exceptions.

            ðŸ”Ž Introducing BioSearch: A Search Engine for Doctors
        </h5>

        <p>Last year I worked on BioSearch, a solo project for one of my computer science classes CS-463, in which I had to build a search engine to help doctors efficiently retrieve clinical cases from their own collections.</p>

        <p>
            Hereâ€™s how it works:
            <ul class="custom-list" id="projects-list">
                <li>A doctor provides an XML collection of clinical cases.</li>
                <li>The engine processes the data, creating an index, a vocabulary, and other necessary components.</li>
                <li>Once indexed, the doctor can perform keyword searches, and the engine retrieves the most relevant documents using cosine similarity scoring.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This project was a great opportunity to dive into indexing, information retrieval, and query processing, building a functional search engine from the ground up.</p>
    
        <p>Of course it can be used with any xml documents collection, but the theme here is for clinical cases.</p>
