        <p>
            Hey! I'm Tasos. Idk how you ended up here, but here we go. This is my personal site, although I like to see it 
            as something more, like my dungeon or whatever :P 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here as the sidebar spoils, I post creative stuff I do, such as 
            projects I've made, music I write, or even sketches I do. Also I upload blogs about silly little ideas that come 
            to mind, something like diary type of blogs.
